                overcoming
                adversity on Everest.

                Despite making her way in the elite macho tech world of Silicon Valley, in private Silvia was lost:
                hiding her sexuality from her family, repressing the abuse of her childhood, and struggling with
                alcoholism.

                Her answer was to heed the call of mountains, where the risk, scale, and brute force woke her up - and
                she took her pain to the biggest ascent possible: Everest.

                Accompanied by a group of young female survivors, this is Silvia's remarkable story of endurance,

                author of To Shake the Sleeping Self. (Preorder for November 7, 2023)

                Jedidiah and his mother, Barbara, had found themselves divided by her version of a faith that views his
                sexuality as a sin.

                But when she turned seventy, Jedidiah realised that his mother wouldn't always be there.

                This was the time for the trip they'd always talked about, and they knew exactly what they'd do: retrace
                the thousands of miles Barbara trekked with Jedidiah's father in the 70s.

                While the original journey became the basis for the bestselling “Walk Across America” trilogy, the goal
                of this adventure was different: to reunite mother and son.</p>
